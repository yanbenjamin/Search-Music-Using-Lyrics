# Search-Music-Using-Lyrics
A program that takes a search query, interprets it as a sequence of song keywords, and identifies / ranks songs that best match those keywords. 
The song data is acquired from the Billboard Top 100 over the last half century. 
The application is for anyone who has a song that keeps playing in their head but can't quite remember its name, which happens to me all the time
